Phone Questions:
1-2 algorithm problems OR 3

//b tree problem
1. write a function that counts the nodes in BS-tree whose values fit in the given range."
Be clear and accurate in syntax, checks, etc.
A C++ prototype may look like this:

//graph problem
2. 'There is a town with N people numbered 0 to N-1. Some people of this town
knows some other people. The relation between them is not necessarily symmetric.
 i.e. If a knows b, doesn't mean b knows a. This town needs a mayor.
 The requisite for being a mayor is that he should be famous and impartial.
 Being famous means that he should be known to everyone in the town. Being
 impartial means that he should not know anyone in the town. Consider a function
 knows(i, j) that return true if i knows j or false otherwise. Write a program
 to return the list of people who are eligible for the mayor's post.'

 3. Tree recursion question, bit manipulation related question

 4. numbers "69", "88", and "818" are all strobogrammatic

 5. Dynamic Programming on strings.

 6. Recursion on binary trees

7. Get used to dynamic programming and don't forget that adjacency lists can be hash tables

8. array longest substring
9.Arrays ambigram
10. John Conway's Game of Life - Implement a method that updated the game board to its next state.
11. disjoint bitsets
12. pattern in list of strings
13. Write a function to tell if three points are colinear.
14. write a method to determine if a number is fibonacci
15. fnding all common parents for set of nodes on a tree
16. matrix class, two sum //might need to know generic programming
