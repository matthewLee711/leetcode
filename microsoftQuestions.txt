Make sure to explain your answer as you go and discuss with them instead of
thinking of it as a question-answer session.
IF PROBLEM HARD, Discuss you're going to use a human solution and develop brute force method
Then, discuss optimization.

Find first common ancestor given 2 nodes in a tree not necessarily a binary tree.

Clone a linked list with random pointer

Design a game of poker and focus was around scoring function of poker.

Variation of merge procedure of merge sort.

Given two integers, return the numbers of matched digit number. For ex, 130 and 239, return 1. 29 and 92, return 0


reverse liked list,
inorder traverse of a tree without recursive,
remove duplicate in array, and
sort algorothm

1. Create a queue (enqueue and dequeue methods) using stacks as your only storage method
2. Binary tree from inorder and preorder traversal pair
3. Find where two linked lists converge in O(n) time and O(1) memory. Linked lists are guarantied to be valid and to converge at some point
4. Print duplicates in an array (you may either print duplicate values many times or just once as they're discovered)

Given a 2-D grid with certain cells (coordinates given) being inaccessible, and
a virtual robot starting in the top left corner that can only go down or right,
write an algorithm that will guarantee that the robot reaches the bottom right
corner of the grid, or determines that a path (given the above constraints)
is impossible.

Reverse a singly linked list

Sort an array

Given a list of numbers, sort them and remove the duplicate numbers.

Two rovers are on a planet and can move and set beacons. How would you get them to crash?

You have two substrings of a string that overlap. How would you put them together into one string?

Find minimum subarray that adds to a particular number

Write an atoi function for scratch.

combine the two arrays in order without using a sort algorithms after the merge?

string of digits like "72388" and int n, delete n characters from the sting
such the resulting string contains minimal number representation, you must
preserve relative position of digits. Example: if st="72388" and n=2,
the answer is 238.

Algorithm to parse string for algebraic operations and solve with respect to order.

Given a directory string "c/a/../b/./d" write a method that outputs the final
directory. (In this example, "c/b/d"). A "." input stays in the current
irectory, a ".." input goes back one.

Design a method midNumbers(start, end, length) that prints the middle values
between two integers. Ex: midNumbers(0,5,2) would print 2,3. midNumbers(1,10,4)
would print 4,5,6,7. This question was left VERY vague and I think it was
intentionally left up to the interviewee to clarify as much as possible. Follow
ups included "How would you check for appropriate input? How would you protect
against attacks, such as a buffer overflow attack? What areâ€¦

How would you convert a row number on Excel to a label? Rows are labeled alphabetically with letters added on once the alphabet has been fully used. (Ex. row # 5 is labeled E, row # 27 is labeled AA, row # 28 is AB, row # 53 is BA and so forth) What would the row label be for a large number, such as 1500?
while(num>0){
    str += getCharFromNum(num%26); // this will return one char from A-Z
    num /= 26;
}
return str;

How to tell if there's a loop in a linked list. <this comes up often

First one is to print out the first 50 Fibonacci numbers.

Given a node of a binary tree, find the next node of the in order traversal of the tree.
Node * getNextInorderNode(Node *in)
{
    if (!in) return in;

    Node *tmp = in->right;
    /* Next Inorder candidate is the leftmost node in the right subtree */
    if(tmp) {
        while(tmp->left) tmp=tmp->left;
        return tmp;
    }

      /* Inorder candidate could be at upper levels */
    tmp=in;
    /* keep going up if tmp is the right child
     * stop only if tmp becomes left child of a parent
     */
    while(tmp->parent && tmp->parent->right == tmp) {
        tmp = tmp->parent;
    }
    if (tmp->parent == NULL) {
        return NULL;
    } else if(tmp->parent->right != tmp &&
            tmp->parent->left == tmp) {
        return tmp->parent;
    }
}

Check whether a piece on a chess board can move from A to B. The function should
return "True or False" if the move is possible. Test cases can range from Pawn
to Bishop or any other piece. You have to know or calculate how a piece would
travel, intersect a path , kill an opponent between A and B.

Calculate the depth of a tree, weather its balanced or not

reverse words in string. e.g. "I am a student." => "student a am I"   <same with this style

Given one array, then remove one element, and shuffle. Find out the removed elements.

How to find the first common node of two list given the head of two linked list

//might not need to know
Implement a method to count the number of '1' symbols in a bit vector in C.

System design/behavioral:
A question related to how to handle the failure of a data input channel

The second question is to describe how mutex works.

The first question is to find out a duplicate number in an array.

They asked me things about BFS, DFS, and tested my proficiency in data structures.

Explain polymorphism as if you are speaking to your Grand mother.

behavioral questions such as "why microsoft"

//Give several solutions*
Design and algorithm, give int 1 return int 2, and int 2 return int 1.

Why are interfaces important?
