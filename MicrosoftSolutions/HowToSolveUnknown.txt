1. Clarify and understand the problem.

2. Begin writing test solutions

3. Tell interviewer you are going to solve with human approach(depends on difficulty)
If know solution, make sure to focus on looking like you are solving.
  A. While solving, discuss problem
    - Identify Data Structures needed.
    - Keep doing this action until.... something complete
  B. Once have basic solution, discuss time/space complexity

4. After come up with human approach, optimize
  A. What do you think of this approach?
  B. I've come up with a solution with this complexity
    - This is the my optimal solution with complexity because....
    - ASK "is this good enough?" ONLY if you are stumped.

5. Start coding!
