//SOlution 1
//O(n), space complexity: O(1)
//Find the lengths of both linked lists
//Get difference between big and small linked list
//after that, offset the big linked list to match the small one.
//EX. move linked list up one 3 -> 2 to match 2 head linked list
//If linked list are the same, then start going

//Solution 2
//O(n), space complexity: O(n)
//one go through
//store each node into HashMap
//after each store, do a check -- only costs O(1)

//HAVE SOLUTION,
